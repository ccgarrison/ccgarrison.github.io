        <p class "s3"> <em>BACKGROUND<em> I graduated from The George Washington University with a degree in Civil Engineering and from Hampton University with a degree in general science. I have over ten years of work experience as a Life Cycle Manager with the Department of the Navy and as a Product Engineer with an automotive supplier. Moving several times with my husband's career I've had to re-invent and adapt myself with each move. Part of my career has been as a stay-at-home mom with a few part time jobs to keep my sanity. Ending with a position at the University of Pittsburgh, Katz Graduate School of Business as an Employment Coordinator for the MBA students.
          TOUGH: The last few years have been tough as an in-home caregiver for both my spouse and caring for my father along with Covid.
          MOVING FORWARD: I have taken a Project Management course through the Virginia Tech continuing education system and now I am currently enrolled in the MIT xPro full stack curriculum program. The program is very challenging and I will be completing the JavaScript and front end segment of the course. As challenging as the course has been I have learned a lot and been inspired by my female cohorts. I've also had a few first by taking this course: first online class, first time coding, first YouTube video and my first GitHub repository!
